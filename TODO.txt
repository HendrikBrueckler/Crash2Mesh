In order of importance/urgency:
[x] Make own viewer class with necessary hotkey config
[x] change Vertex properties to model cyclic duplication of non-manifold vertices
[x] change mesh initialization to init cyclic duplicate lists
[x] change decimation operator to apply it to all duplicates at the same time
[x] change all affected decimation modules to consider duplicate vertices
[PARTIALLY] improve splitting of non-manifold edges/vertices
[x] make floodflip NOT recursive (use stack)
[x] show number of duplicate mesh triangles in analyzer stats
[x] detect epicenter of impact
[x] adapt error quadric weighting to take into account distance from epicenter
[x] see which other modules would benefit from taking distance from epicenter into account
[x] detect vertices connected to PLINKs/BEAMs etc. and preserve these!
[x] triangulate arbitrary faces (other than triangles and quads)
[x] establish a way to decimate partwise first and global after
[x] establish a common decimation criterion (global error bound) and how to deduce it
