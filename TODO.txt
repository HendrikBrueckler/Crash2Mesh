In order of importance/urgency:
[x] Make own viewer class with necessary hotkey config
[ ] change Vertex properties to model cyclic duplication of non-manifold vertices
[ ] change decimation operator to apply it to all duplicates at the same time
[ ] change all affected decimation modules to consider duplicate vertices
[ ] detect vertices connected to PLINKs/BEAMs etc. and preserve these!
[ ] clean up code
[ ] comment all code
[ ] triangulate arbitrary faces (other than triangles and quads)
[ ] establish a common decimation criterion (global error bound) and how to deduce it
[ ] specify output format and code up output writer
[ ] implement output function that uses file format usable in MeshLab
[ ] use MeshLab to judge single-frame approximation errors
[ ] make compilable on windows
[ ] optimize runtime of reading
[ ] optimize performance of decimation algorithm
[ ] optimize runtime of decimation algorithm
[ ] optimize memory consumption
[ ] split reading into 1) read element/part connectivity, 2) per part read node
    positions, 3) per part read plastic strains
[ ] establish a way to decimate partwise first and global after
