In order of importance/urgency:
[x] Make own viewer class with necessary hotkey config
[x] change Vertex properties to model cyclic duplication of non-manifold vertices
[x] change mesh initialization to init cyclic duplicate lists
[x] change decimation operator to apply it to all duplicates at the same time
[x] change all affected decimation modules to consider duplicate vertices
[PARTIALLY] improve splitting of non-manifold edges/vertices
[x] make floodflip NOT recursive (use stack)
[x] show number of duplicate mesh triangles in analyzer stats
[x] detect epicenter of impact
[x] adapt error quadric weighting to take into account distance from epicenter
[x] see which other modules would benefit from taking distance from epicenter into account
[x] detect vertices connected to PLINKs/BEAMs etc. and preserve these!
[x] triangulate arbitrary faces (other than triangles and quads)
[x] establish a way to decimate partwise first and global after
[x] establish a common decimation criterion (global error bound) and how to deduce it
[x] parallelize partwise decimation
[x] specify output format and code up output writer
[x] make compilable on windows
[x] clean up code
[x] comment all header code
[x] fix decimation of non-manifold elements (shits broken...)
[x] optimize runtime of reading
[PARTIALLY] optimize memory consumption
[PARTIALLY] implement proper distance-to-epicenter weighting functions for each module
[x] transfer quadrics from first decimation step over to global decimation
[x] optionally allow for position optimization on each collapse
[x] probabilistic plane matrix
[x] check why mesh assembling is not deterministic
[THIS SUCKS] postprocess decimation by moving all vertices to optimal position for each frame, compare to other pos optimization
[could be improved] HOW 2 HANDLE DAMPFWALZE (other than just throwing it out completely)
[x] transfer normalcones from first decimation step over to global decimation
[x] combine continuous normalcones with quadrics
[ ] find better seed faces for floodFlip
[ ] HOW 2 HANDLE FAILURE VECTOR

[ ] update to newest easy3d version OR switch to OpenFlipper
[ ] implement GUI for selecting important parts

[ ] optimize performance of decimation algorithm
[ ] optimize runtime of decimation algorithm

[ ] find a way to judge results (Hausdorff-distance will be baaad for parts away from epicenter)
[ ] implement output function that uses file format usable in MeshLab
[ ] use MeshLab to judge single-frame approximation errors

[ ] clean up code
[ ] comment all header code
